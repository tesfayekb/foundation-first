# Plan Changelog

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-08

## Purpose

Tracks every plan revision with full traceability across:
- Plan sections
- Approved decisions
- Supersession chains

This document is the authoritative history of all plan changes.

## Scope

All changes to:
- `master-plan.md`
- `approved-decisions.md`

## Enforcement Rule (CRITICAL)

- Every plan change MUST create a changelog entry
- No change may occur without being recorded here
- If an entry is missing or incomplete → the change is **INVALID**
- History must **NEVER** be overwritten — only appended

## Versioning Rules

- Each plan revision increments version: `vN` → `vN+1`
- Versions are immutable once recorded
- No version may be edited after creation

## Changelog Format (MANDATORY)

Each entry MUST include:

- **Plan Version** (e.g., v1 → v2)
- **Date**
- **Section IDs Changed**
- **Decision IDs Affected** (DEC-NNN)
- **What Changed**
- **Why It Changed**
- **What Stayed Unchanged**
- **What Was Added**
- **What Was Removed**
- **Approval Status**
- **Supersession Links** (if applicable)

If any field is missing → entry is **INVALID**.

## Diff Requirement

Each entry MUST align with the required plan diff:
- Sections unchanged (by ID)
- Sections modified (with reason)
- Sections added (new IDs)
- Sections removed (with justification)
- Conflicts with approved decisions (DEC-NNN)

## Entries

### v0 → v1 (2026-04-08)

**Type:** Initial creation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plan Version | v0 → v1 |
| Section IDs Created | PLAN-GOV-001, PLAN-AUTH-001, PLAN-RBAC-001, PLAN-USRMGMT-001, PLAN-ADMIN-001, PLAN-USRPNL-001, PLAN-AUDIT-001, PLAN-HEALTH-001, PLAN-API-001, PLAN-JOBS-001 |
| Decision IDs Affected | DEC-001, DEC-002, DEC-003, DEC-005 |
| What Changed | Initial plan created |
| Why | Project initialization |
| What Stayed | N/A |
| What Was Added | All plan sections |
| What Was Removed | None |
| Approval Status | PLAN-GOV-001: implemented; others: proposed |
| Supersession Links | None |

### v1 → v2 (2026-04-08)

**Type:** Corrective alignment — audit issue fixes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plan Version | v1 → v2 |
| Section IDs Changed | None |
| Decision IDs Affected | DEC-002 (superseded by DEC-006), DEC-006 (new), DEC-007 (new) |
| What Changed | DEC-002 superseded — Constitution has 11 rules, not 10. OQ-003 formally resolved with DEC-007 (audit retention 90 days). Added `normalizeRequest()` to Function Index. Added `roles.create` and `roles.delete` to Permission Index. Added provisional moderator disclaimers. Fixed permission matrix to permission-driven model. Fixed `app_role` vs `TEXT` type mismatch. |
| Why | Final audit identified 7 consistency gaps (score 98.5/100). All fixes are corrective alignment — no structural changes. |
| What Stayed | All plan sections, all other decisions, all module definitions, all existing index entries |
| What Was Added | DEC-006, DEC-007, `normalizeRequest()` function entry, `roles.create` + `roles.delete` permission entries, provisional disclaimers |
| What Was Removed | None |
| Approval Status | Approved |
| Supersession Links | DEC-002 → DEC-006 |

## Supersession Chain Requirement

For any modification to an approved section:

Must include:
- `prior_section_id`
- `new_section_id`
- `decision_id`
- `reason`
- `date`

Must maintain full traceability:
- plan → decision → changelog → updated plan

## No Silent Change Rule

No modification to `master-plan.md` or `approved-decisions.md` may occur without:
- Corresponding changelog entry
- Proper version increment
- Recorded diff

Violations = **INVALID** change.

## Dependencies

- [Master Plan](master-plan.md)
- [Approved Decisions](approved-decisions.md)

## Used By / Affects

- Plan governance
- Decision traceability
- Historical auditing

## Risks If Changed

HIGH — loss of traceability breaks system integrity and decision history.
