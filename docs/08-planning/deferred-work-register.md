# Deferred Work Register

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-13

## Purpose

Authoritative registry for postponed items that were originally part of an approved plan section. Ensures deferred work is not lost, is formally tracked with blocking dependencies, and is explicitly reassigned to a future phase before that phase begins.

**This is NOT for new feature proposals** — those belong in [feature-proposals.md](feature-proposals.md).
This document is for work that was **already approved** in the master plan but could not be completed in its original phase.

## Scope

All deferred subsections, gate items, or deliverables from approved plan sections that were not completed in their original phase.

## Enforcement Rules (CRITICAL)

- When any approved plan subsection is marked `deferred`, a corresponding entry **MUST** be created here
- When any phase gate item is deferred or marked N/A, a corresponding entry **MUST** be created here
- No phase may be formally closed with deferred items unless all deferred items have entries in this register
- Deferred items **MUST** be assigned to a future phase before that phase's planning begins
- Unassigned deferred items must be reviewed at every phase boundary
- Items may only be `cancelled` via change control with a decision record (DEC-NNN)

## Entry Schema (MANDATORY)

Each deferred item MUST include all of the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique ID: `DW-NNN` |
| `date_deferred` | Date the item was deferred |
| `source_plan_section` | Original plan section ID (e.g., PLAN-AUTH-001-B) |
| `source_phase` | Phase where work was originally planned |
| `title` | Short descriptive title |
| `reason_deferred` | Why it could not be completed |
| `blocking_dependencies` | What must be resolved before resuming |
| `impact_on_source_phase` | How deferral affected the source phase's completion |
| `future_owner_phase` | Target phase for resumption (or `unassigned`) |
| `future_owner_module` | Module that will own this work |
| `required_plan_realignment` | What plan changes are needed when this work resumes |
| `related_decisions` | DEC-NNN references |
| `related_actions` | ACT-NNN references |
| `required_tests_for_closure` | Tests/gates that must pass when implemented |
| `status` | See status legend below |
| `implemented_by_action` | ACT-NNN when eventually implemented |
| `implemented_in_plan_version` | Plan version when implemented |

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `deferred` | Postponed, not yet assigned to a future phase |
| `assigned` | Assigned to a specific future phase |
| `in-progress` | Actively being implemented in the assigned phase |
| `implemented` | Completed and verified |
| `cancelled` | Permanently dropped via change control |

## Phase Boundary Review Rule

At each phase boundary (before advancing to the next phase):

1. Review ALL open deferred items (status = `deferred` or `assigned`)
2. Confirm blocking dependencies are still accurate
3. Confirm future phase assignment is still appropriate
4. If a deferred item's future phase is the upcoming phase → it **MUST** be included in that phase's scope
5. Document review outcome in action tracker

| **ID** | DW-004 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 (Phase 2 gate item 10) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | RLS tested at database level (not just API) |
| **Reason Deferred** | Requires manual DB-level testing with test users in different role contexts |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Deployed schema; test users with assigned roles; ability to execute queries as different Postgres roles |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 2 gate remains open |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (pre-integration) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Must be completed before any Phase 3 module writes RLS-dependent queries |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-017, ACT-019 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Anonymous/anon-key query returns zero rows on protected tables; regular user sees only own user_roles; admin sees role-gated rows; superadmin sees all; write attempts without policy denied |

### DW-005: Cross-Tenant Isolation Gate Scope Resolution

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-005 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 (Phase 2 gate item 11) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Cross-tenant isolation verification |
| **Reason Deferred** | System is single-tenant for v1 — gate item is mis-scoped for current architecture |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Change control decision to either mark N/A for v1 or defer to multi-tenancy introduction |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 2 gate technically open; requires plan amendment to resolve |
| **Future Owner Phase** | `unassigned` — pending plan amendment via change control |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Amend Phase 2 gate item 11 via change control to reflect v1 single-tenant scope |
| **Related Decisions** | DEC-022 |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-017, ACT-019 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | If multi-tenancy introduced: zero-rows cross-tenant queries, tenant-scoped RLS policies |

### DW-006: Role Change Cache Invalidation Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-006 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 (Phase 2 gate item 12) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Role change immediately reflected (cache invalidation verified) |
| **Reason Deferred** | No permission cache exists; fresh RPC fetches used. Runtime E2E verification of role-change propagation to UI not yet performed |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Deployed edge functions; test user with assignable roles; runtime E2E test capability |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 2 gate remains open |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (pre-integration) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Must verify before admin panel role management UI is built in Phase 4 |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-017 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Assign role → verify UI reflects new permissions without page reload; revoke role → verify UI removes permissions; verify no stale authorization state |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | ACT-020 |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v7 |
| **Resolution Note** | No permission cache exists — architecture uses fresh DB queries via get_my_authorization_context() RPC on every check. Role changes are inherently immediate. Last-superadmin guard trigger fires instantly. |

### DW-007: Moderator Role

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-007 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Moderator role deferred to v2 |
| **Reason Deferred** | Decided to limit v1 to superadmin/admin/user only |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | v2 planning and scope definition |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | None — v1 RBAC schema supports dynamic roles; moderator can be added without schema change |
| **Future Owner Phase** | `unassigned` — v2 scope |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | v2 planning must include moderator role definition, permission mapping, and UI integration |
| **Related Decisions** | DEC-018 (moderator deferred to v2) |
| **Related Actions** | — |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Moderator role CRUD, permission matrix, admin panel integration, E2E tests |
| **Status** | `deferred` |

### DW-008: MFA Recovery Codes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-008 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-AUTH-001-D |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 1 — Foundation (Auth) |
| **Title** | MFA recovery code generation, storage, and usage |
| **Reason Deferred** | Core MFA (TOTP enroll + verify) prioritized first; recovery codes are secondary safety net |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | MFA enrollment flow operational (done); hashed storage mechanism for recovery codes; UI for code display + regeneration |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 1 closed as `approved-partial` — MFA enrollment works but recovery path not yet available |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 4 — Admin & User Interfaces (user-panel MFA configuration) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-AUTH-001, PLAN-USRPNL-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 4 user-panel MFA configuration section must include recovery code generation, display, regeneration, and single-use consumption |
| **Related Decisions** | DEC-017 (MFA recovery code format: 10 codes, 8 alphanumeric, single-use, hashed storage) |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-010, ACT-011 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Recovery code generation (10 codes returned), code display + copy UX, single-use consumption (code works once then invalidated), full set regeneration (old codes invalidated), hashed storage verification (no plaintext in DB), recovery code + re-enrollment flow |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | ACT-064 |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v11.0 |

### DW-009: requireRole() Shared Function

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-009 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Server-side requireRole() guard function |
| **Reason Deferred** | Phase 2 focused on schema, helpers, and edge function foundation; requireRole() is a consumer-facing guard needed when modules start enforcing role checks |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | has_role() DB function operational (done); edge function auth pattern established (done) |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact on Phase 2 gate — requireRole() is a downstream consumer utility, not a gate item |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (needed before user-management and API modules enforce role checks) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001, PLAN-API-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 3 must implement requireRole() before any edge function uses role-based access control |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-015, ACT-017 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Correct role → access allowed; wrong role → 403; no role → 403; superadmin bypass verified; integration with edge function auth pattern |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | ACT-023 |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | Phase 3 Stage 3A |

### DW-010: requireSelfScope() Shared Function

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-010 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Server-side requireSelfScope() guard function |
| **Reason Deferred** | Phase 2 focused on schema, helpers, and edge function foundation; requireSelfScope() is needed when user-owned resource endpoints are built |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | getSessionContext() operational (done); user-owned resource endpoints exist (Phase 3/4) |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact on Phase 2 gate — requireSelfScope() is a downstream consumer utility |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (needed before user-management self-scope endpoints) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001, PLAN-USRMGMT-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 3 must implement requireSelfScope() before user-management self-edit/self-view endpoints |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-015, ACT-017 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Own resource → access allowed; other user's resource → 403; admin override if applicable; null/missing userId → 403 |

### DW-011: Distributed Rate Limiting

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-011 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-API-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (API) |
| **Title** | Distributed/shared rate limiting for privileged endpoints |
| **Reason Deferred** | Current in-memory per-isolate rate limiting is adequate defense-in-depth for development but not institutional-grade for production — cold starts reset counters, no cross-isolate coordination |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Redis/Upstash or equivalent distributed store; production traffic patterns for tuning |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact — current limiter is functional and deployed; this is a hardening improvement |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 — Hardening & System Validation |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-API-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 6 must include: centralized rate limit backing store, durable counters, abuse telemetry, admin monitoring dashboard integration |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-027 (rate limiting introduced), ACT-028 (rate limiter hardened) |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Cross-isolate rate limit enforcement, cold-start counter persistence, abuse pattern detection, admin dashboard rate limit visibility |
| **Status** | `deferred (v2)` |
| **Implemented by Action** | N/A — deferred to v2. In-memory per-isolate limiter retained as defense-in-depth. Requires Upstash Redis for institutional-grade enforcement. |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v11.0 (closure decision) |

### DW-012: Authenticated lifecycle test infrastructure (409, rollback-path coverage)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-012 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-USRMGMT-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (User Management) |
| **Title** | Authenticated lifecycle test infrastructure for 409 + rollback-path coverage |
| **Reason Deferred** | Tests for already-deactivated (409), already-active (409), invalid UUID (400), missing body (400) require authenticated admin tokens. Rollback-path tests (unban failure → no status change, profile update failure → re-ban) require mockable wrappers around `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin` calls for failure injection. Neither infrastructure exists yet. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Test harness for admin token provisioning; mockable auth admin client wrapper; non-production failure injection mechanism |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Moderate — current unauthenticated boundary tests provide basic coverage; auth-required paths are the higher-value regression surface |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 — Hardening & System Validation |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-USRMGMT-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 6 must include: test admin user provisioning, auth admin mock wrapper, failure injection for deactivate/reactivate rollback paths, auto-cleanup of test artifacts |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-030 (regression tests created), ACT-031 (evidence corrected) |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | deactivate already-deactivated → 409; reactivate already-active → 409; invalid UUID → 400; missing body → 400; unban failure → no profile change; profile update failure after unban → re-ban; ban failure on deactivation → rollback to active; audit write failure → no mutation |
| **Status** | `deferred (v2)` |
| **Implemented by Action** | — |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | — |
| **Scope Expansion Note (2026-04-13)** | Scope expanded from original deactivate-user 409/rollback paths to cover all 36 edge functions (~151 integration tests). Expanded scope includes: privilege escalation regression suite (GAP 1 — admin→admin assignment blocked, superadmin-only permissions enforced), audit integrity suite (every mutation produces audit entry, IP redaction for non-superadmin, null IP preserved for system events), input validation suite (malformed UUIDs, oversized payloads, missing fields), and rate limiting verification. Original scope is a subset of the expanded coverage. Rate limiting tests require care: Supabase's built-in function-level throttling means hitting deployed functions 11+ times in rapid succession — must avoid triggering limits on the test runner itself. |
| **Implementation Plan (2026-04-13)** | **Architecture:** Single orchestrated test file (`supabase/functions/_integration/index_test.ts`) with extracted helpers. Two test users (superadmin + regular), sequential execution with setup/teardown. Pattern proven in `get-profile/index_test.ts`. **Tier 1 — Universal (~89 tests):** 28 JWT-auth functions × 3 tests (401/CORS/405) = 84 tests + 5 CORS-only tests for 4 cron functions (job-health-check, job-metrics-aggregate, job-alert-evaluation, job-audit-cleanup use CRON_SECRET not JWT) + 1 public function (health-check returns 200 without auth). **Tier 2 — Input Validation (~20 tests):** Missing required fields, invalid UUID format, empty body, oversized body (>64KB → 413). **Tier 3 — Authenticated Happy Path (~18 tests):** Superadmin token calling read endpoints + superadmin-only endpoints (export-audit-logs, jobs-kill-switch [GET not POST], health-alert-config). **Tier 4 — Privilege Escalation (~14 tests):** Regular user calling admin-only endpoints → 403. Includes health-alert-config GET + PATCH (monitoring.configure is superadmin-only), jobs-kill-switch (GET, jobs.emergency is superadmin-only). **Tier 5 — Business Logic (~10 tests):** Self-deactivation block, last-superadmin guard, duplicate assignment handling, non-existent resource 404s. **Skipped:** Rate limiting (throttle risk to test runner), MFA flows (TOTP automation impossible), verify-turnstile (requires Cloudflare widget token). **Existing coverage overlap:** 4 test files with ~45 tests cover 6 functions — new integration file cross-references but does not duplicate. **Total: ~151 tests.** |

### DW-013: Orphaned test-user cleanup automation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-013 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-USRMGMT-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (User Management) |
| **Title** | Automated test-user cleanup after lifecycle verification |
| **Reason Deferred** | Supabase `auth.admin.deleteUser()` fails when profile triggers have FK or validation dependencies. Manual dashboard deletion is required. Future test harnesses must auto-clean on both success and failure paths. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Understanding of Supabase auth deletion trigger chain; test harness design |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Low — only 3 orphaned users; operational not security risk |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 — Hardening & System Validation |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-USRMGMT-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Test harness must include cleanup-on-exit for all test users |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-031 (orphan documented) |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Verify test-user creation and deletion both succeed programmatically |
| **Status** | `deferred (v2)` |

### DW-014: Denial Audit Logging

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-014 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-AUDIT-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (Audit) |
| **Title** | Audit log entries for permission denials |
| **Reason Deferred** | Gate 1 reviewer noted denied actions are enforced but not logged to audit trail. Current behavior is fail-secure (403 returned) but denials are not auditable. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | None — logAuditEvent infrastructure exists; requires adding calls on PermissionDeniedError catch paths |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact — Phase 3 gates passed. This is a hardening improvement. |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3.5 — Security Hardening |

| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-035 (Gate 1 reviewer note) |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Denied request → audit_logs entry with action='auth.permission_denied'; log contains actor_id, permission_key, correlation_id; no sensitive data in denial metadata |

| **Implemented by Action** | Phase 3.5A — Stage 3.5 plan execution |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v9 |
| **Resolution Note** | Centralized denial interception in handler.ts. PermissionDeniedError enriched with userId (authoritative) and reason. JWT fallback as best-effort enrichment only. actor_id nullable (no fake sentinels). Event: auth.permission_denied with metadata including permission_key, reason, endpoint, actor_known, correlation_id. Runtime-verified: permission denial + cross-user access both produce correct audit rows. |

### DW-015: Superadmin Guardrails

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-015 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Superadmin guardrails for high-risk RBAC actions |
| **Reason Deferred** | Gate 1 reviewer noted superadmin bypasses all permission checks via is_superadmin(). High-risk actions (role changes, user deletion) have no additional gate even for superadmin. Design note, not a security vulnerability. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Design decision on which actions require explicit permission even for superadmin |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact — Phase 3 gates passed. This is an A+ hardening recommendation. |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3.5 — Security Hardening |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | No RBAC redesign. Surgical hardening only: requireRecentAuth on RBAC endpoints + self-superadmin-revocation prevention. |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-035 (Gate 1 reviewer note) |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | All 6 high-risk endpoints enforce requireRecentAuth(); self-superadmin-revocation blocked with 403; no new SQL functions; no RBAC model drift |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | Phase 3.5B — Stage 3.5 plan execution |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v9 |
| **Resolution Note** | Added requireRecentAuth() to assign-role, revoke-role, assign-permission-to-role, revoke-permission-from-role (4 endpoints that were missing it). Self-superadmin-revocation prevention added to revoke-role (403 if actor revokes own superadmin role). No new SQL functions, no new seed data, no RBAC model changes. Existing has_permission()/is_superadmin() behavior unchanged. |
| **Supersession Note (2026-04-13)** | This DW-015 scope was **significantly expanded** in the RBAC Governance Hardening session (2026-04-13). New work includes: (1) permanent superadmin-only permission enforcement at both server and UI layers for permissions.assign, permissions.revoke, roles.create, roles.edit, roles.delete, jobs.emergency — these can never be assigned to any non-superadmin role; (2) user-role permission inheritance visibility — base permissions from the `user` role display as inherited/disabled on all other roles with correct effective counts; (3) reauth dialog architecture fix — resolved TanStack Query v5 onError ordering conflict that prevented reauth dialog from opening; (4) 8 button-level UI gaps closed with permission-gated controls. See [RBAC Governance Hardening Closure](phase-closures/rbac-governance-hardening-closure.md) for full details. |

| **ID** | DW-021 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-11 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 (user management) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 4 — Admin & User Interfaces (Stage 4B) |
| **Title** | Replace auth.admin.listUsers() email search with DB-level mechanism |
| **Reason Deferred** | Current list-users email search uses auth.admin.listUsers(perPage:1000) + in-memory filter + ID injection. Works at small scale with caching and 500-ID cap, but not institution-grade for large tenants. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | DB view or function joining profiles + auth email, or materialized email column synced to profiles |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact — Stage 4B functionally complete; this is a scalability hardening item |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 — Hardening & System Validation |

| **Title** | Single DB-level query/view returning fully shaped admin user objects |
| **Reason Deferred** | Current list-users enriches profiles with email + roles via separate queries in app layer. Functionally correct with batch approach, but not optimally server-shaped. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | DB view or function combining profiles + email + roles into single result set |

| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 (user detail) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 4 — Admin & User Interfaces (Stage 4B) |
| **Title** | Audit trail actor display name resolution and actor-as-subject scope |
| **Reason Deferred** | Current user detail audit trail shows events where user is target only, not actor. Actor IDs are raw UUIDs without display name resolution. Both are UX improvements, not plan violations. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Actor display name enrichment in audit query response; design decision on actor-scope inclusion |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact — target-scope audit is correct for Stage 4B |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 5+ (deeper audit UX work) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-ADMIN-001, PLAN-AUDIT-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Future audit UX phase must include actor enrichment |

### DW-024: Admin Panel Unbounded Client-Side Aggregation Queries

| Field | Value |

| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 (admin dashboard + role list) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 4 — Admin & User Interfaces (Stage 4B + 4C) |
| **Title** | AdminDashboard useRolesBreakdown and AdminRolesPage fetchRoles fetch unbounded tables client-side |
| **Reason Deferred** | (1) useRolesBreakdown fetches entire user_roles table with .select('role_id') and no limit. (2) fetchRoles fetches all role_permissions and all user_roles to compute per-role permission/user counts. Both are RLS-enforced and correct at current scale, but unbounded for large tenants. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | DB functions for role assignment counts / permission counts, or server-side aggregation endpoint |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact — correct at current scale |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 — Hardening & System Validation |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 6 must include dashboard + role list query optimization |
| **Related Decisions** | — |

### DW-025: Role Creation (create-role Edge Function + UI)

| Field | Value |

| **ID** | DW-025 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-11 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 (admin-panel.md documents role CRUD as planned capability) |
| **Original Description** | Allow admins with `roles.create` permission to create new custom roles via edge function and admin UI form. Permission `roles.create` already exists in the database. |
| **Why Deferred** | Stage 4C scope was explicitly limited to role list/detail and assign/revoke operations. Role creation was documented in admin-panel.md but never scheduled into any stage plan. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | None — `roles.create` permission already seeded. Requires new `create-role` edge function + UI form. |
| **Target Phase** | Phase 6 (hardening) |
| **Risk If Forgotten** | Medium — admins cannot create custom roles, limiting RBAC flexibility. All roles must be seeded via SQL. |

### DW-026: Role Deletion (delete-role Edge Function + UI)

| Field | Value |

| **ID** | DW-026 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-11 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 (admin-panel.md documents role CRUD as planned capability) |
| **Original Description** | Allow admins with `roles.delete` permission to delete non-immutable, non-base roles. Permission `roles.delete` already exists in the database. DB trigger `prevent_immutable_role_delete` already protects immutable roles. |
| **Why Deferred** | Stage 4C scope was explicitly limited to role list/detail and assign/revoke. Role deletion was never scheduled. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | DW-025 (role creation should land first so there are deletable roles). Must handle cascade: reassign or block if users are assigned to the role. |
| **Target Phase** | Phase 6 (hardening) |
| **Risk If Forgotten** | Low — immutable roles cannot be deleted anyway; custom roles (once DW-025 lands) would accumulate without cleanup. |

### DW-027: Admin Edit User Profile (users.edit_any UI)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-027 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-11 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-ADMIN-001 (admin-panel.md documents admin user editing as planned capability) |
| **Original Description** | Allow admins with `users.edit_any` permission to edit another user's display name and avatar via the admin UI. The `update-profile` edge function already partially supports admin edits (it accepts `user_id` param). The `users.edit_any` permission is seeded in the DB. Only the admin-side UI form on UserDetailPage is missing. |
| **Why Deferred** | Stage 4B scope covered view/deactivate/reactivate only. Admin profile editing was not scheduled into any stage. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Stage 4E (user self-service profile edit) should land first to establish the profile editing pattern. |
| **Target Phase** | Phase 4 (Stage 4K) |
| **Risk If Forgotten** | Medium — `users.edit_any` permission exists but is non-functional from UI; admins must use direct DB access to edit user profiles. |

### DW-028: True Fail-Closed Audit Rollback for health-alert-config Update Path

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-028 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-12 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-HEALTH-001 (Stage 5B — health-alert-config endpoint) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 5 — Operations & Reliability |
| **Title** | True fail-closed audit rollback for alert config update |
| **Reason Deferred** | The update path persists the DB change before calling `logAuditEvent()`. If audit fails, the change remains in DB but the caller receives 500. True rollback requires pre-fetching old values before the update statement, which adds complexity for a low-frequency operation. Practical risk is acceptable: config changes are rare, the 500 surfaces the error, and missing audit records are detectable via monitoring gap analysis. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | None — implementation is straightforward (pre-fetch + restore on audit failure) |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Minimal — alert config updates still work; only the audit trail is incomplete on failure |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 |
| **Future Owner Module** | health-monitoring |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Add pre-fetch + restore logic to `health-alert-config` update path |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-058 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | (1) Update with simulated audit failure restores original values. (2) Caller receives appropriate error. (3) No orphaned config changes without audit records. |

### DW-029: Batched Audit Cleanup DELETE

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-029 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-12 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-JOBS-001 (Stage 5D — audit_cleanup job) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 5 — Operations & Reliability |
| **Title** | Batched DELETE for audit_cleanup job |
| **Reason Deferred** | The current implementation does a single unbounded `DELETE FROM audit_logs WHERE created_at < cutoff`. The Supabase REST API does not support LIMIT on DELETE. At current scale (near-zero records) this is fine, but at millions of rows over 90 days the single DELETE will exceed the 30-second edge function timeout. The correct fix is a PostgreSQL function (via RPC) that deletes in batches of N rows and returns the count. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | None — requires creating an RPC function for batched delete |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Minimal — audit cleanup works correctly at current scale |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 6 |
| **Future Owner Module** | jobs-and-scheduler |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Add `rpc_batch_delete_audit_logs(cutoff, batch_size)` DB function and update `job-audit-cleanup` to call it in a loop |
| **Related Decisions** | DEC-007 (90-day retention) |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-060 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | (1) Batch delete removes correct records. (2) Multiple batches complete within timeout. (3) No records newer than cutoff are deleted. |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | Phase 5 Stage 5D implementation |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v11.0 |
| **Resolution Note** | Batched loop implemented in `job-audit-cleanup/index.ts` with `BATCH_SIZE = 1000`, 25-second timeout budget (`TIMEOUT_BUDGET_MS = 25_000`) — time-based rather than count-based, superior to fixed MAX_ITERATIONS approach as it handles any volume within the 30s edge function limit. Break-on-empty exits when `count < BATCH_SIZE`. Execution metadata includes `totalDeleted` + `elapsed_ms`. `idx_audit_logs_created_at` index confirmed present in schema. `rpc_batch_delete_audit_logs` RPC exists via migration 20260412095151. No inter-batch pause — intentional: timeout-budget approach runs as fast as possible while respecting the time limit. |

| **Source Plan Section** | Performance & Quality Audit Round 2 — Build & Configuration |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 6 — Performance Optimization |
| **Title** | Enable TypeScript strict mode (strict: true in tsconfig.app.json) |

| **Source Plan Section** | Performance & Quality Audit Round 2 — Load Strategy |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 6 — Performance Optimization |
| **Title** | Add Workbox-based service worker for offline asset caching |
| **Reason Deferred** | Architectural decision needed on caching strategy, cache invalidation, and offline behavior for an admin panel. Lower priority — admin panels rarely need offline support. Worth +3 audit points. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Decision on cache-first vs network-first strategy; Workbox configuration design |

| **Title** | HTTP response headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HTTP/2 early hints) |
| **Reason Deferred** | These headers must be configured at the CDN/hosting layer, not in application code. Meta tags are advisory only. Worth +4 audit points total. |

### DW-034: Superadmin Assignment Notification Email

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-034 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-13 |
| **Source Plan Section** | RBAC Governance Hardening |
| **Source Phase** | Post-Phase 6 |
| **Title** | Out-of-band email notification when superadmin is assigned |
| **Reason Deferred** | No transactional email service configured for v1. The event is fully audited in audit_logs (rbac.role_assigned with assigned_by_is_superadmin: true) but no email notification fires. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Transactional email provider integration (SendGrid, Resend, or similar) |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | None — audit trail is complete; email is defense-in-depth |
| **Future Owner Phase** | `unassigned` (v2) |
| **Future Owner Module** | RBAC, Auth |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | v2 must include email notification service and template for superadmin assignment events |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | — |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Superadmin assignment triggers email to both assignor and assignee; email contains actor, target, timestamp, correlation ID; no sensitive data in email body |
| **Status** | `deferred (v2)` |
| **Implemented by Action** | — |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | — |

### DW-035: Invite-Only Signup Flow

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-035 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-13 |
| **Source Plan Section** | RBAC Governance Hardening |
| **Source Phase** | Post-Phase 6 |
| **Title** | Admin-controlled invite-only user signup (disable open registration) |
| **Reason Deferred** | Currently any person can register at the sign-up URL. All RBAC protections mean registered users have no admin access without explicit role assignment, but the open signup surface exists. Full invite flow requires email token generation, invite management UI, and Supabase signup restriction. |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Transactional email provider; invite token edge function; invite management admin UI; Supabase "Allow new users to sign up" dashboard setting coordination |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | None — all registered users are properly RBAC-gated; open signup is a governance preference not a security vulnerability |
| **Future Owner Phase** | `unassigned` (v2) |
| **Future Owner Module** | Auth, Admin Panel |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | v2 must include: invite token generation endpoint, invite list admin UI, email delivery of invite links, Supabase signup restriction toggle, first-signup bootstrap compatibility (first invite = superadmin) |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | — |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Non-invited email cannot create account; invited email can create account via token; expired invite rejected; invite revocation works; first invite creates superadmin correctly |
| **Status** | `deferred (v2)` |
| **Implemented by Action** | — |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | — |

### DW-036: Global Error Monitoring (Sentry/Datadog)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-036 |
| **Original Plan Section** | Post-closure security hardening gap analysis (GAP 7) |
| **Original Phase** | RBAC Governance Hardening |
| **Deferred Reason** | Requires third-party integration (Sentry/Datadog) with PII scrubbing configuration; not addressable within current edge function + UI architecture alone |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Selection of monitoring vendor; PII scrubbing policy definition; budget approval for SaaS integration; **CI/CD pipeline or manual source map upload process** (Lovable handles deploys internally — source maps require either GitHub Actions workflow on push to main, or manual upload via `sentry-cli` after build, or alternative hosting provider's build pipeline) |
| **Future Phase Assignment** | Pre-production (before first real user signup) |
| **Impact if Not Done** | Production errors invisible without user reports; attack pattern detection limited to audit logs only; no frontend error telemetry |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Implementation plan documented 2026-04-13. Sentry free tier sufficient. Session Replay (`@sentry/replay`) **not recommended** for admin console — adds ~50KB bundle for low-value replay data in admin context. Rely on breadcrumbs + structured context instead. Add replay only if errors are regularly hard to reproduce. Source map upload requires CI/CD decision: if deploying via Lovable, use GitHub Actions; if migrating to Vercel/Netlify/other, use that provider's build pipeline. |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | — |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Error boundary captures and reports unhandled exceptions; PII (emails, tokens) scrubbed from payloads; error telemetry reaches monitoring dashboard; source maps resolve stack traces to original TypeScript |
| **Status** | `partially-implemented (code complete — awaiting production deployment)` |
| **Implemented by Action** | SDK integration completed 2026-04-13. |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | — |
| **Resolution Note** | `@sentry/react` installed, `Sentry.init()` configured in `src/main.tsx` with PII scrubbing (email + JWT redacted) and Session Replay disabled. `ErrorBoundary` reports uncaught exceptions to Sentry. `api-client.ts` captures 5xx errors with correlation IDs. Dev mode disabled (`enabled: import.meta.env.PROD`). Vite dedupe configured. Activates automatically when `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is set in production environment. Remaining deployment-step items: (1) Set `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` in hosting provider env vars. (2) Source map upload via CI/CD pipeline (deployment-provider dependent). |

### DW-037: Remove .env from Git Tracking

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-037 |
| **Original Plan Section** | Post-closure security hardening gap analysis (GAP 3) |
| **Original Phase** | RBAC Governance Hardening |
| **Deferred Reason** | Required manual git state commands (`git rm --cached .env`) which cannot be executed by AI tooling |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Manual developer action in local terminal |
| **Future Phase Assignment** | Immediate — next developer session |
| **Impact if Not Done** | `.env` pattern risk: accidental commit of real secrets (service role key, third-party API keys) to version control |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Run: `echo ".env" >> .gitignore && git rm --cached .env && git commit -m "chore: remove .env from git tracking"` |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | — |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | `.env` not present in `git ls-files`; `.gitignore` contains `.env` entry |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | Manual git operation (2026-04-13) |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | — |
| **Resolution Note** | `.env` removed from git index via `git rm --cached .env`. `.gitignore` updated with `.env` entry. Verified: `.env` not in git index, not in HEAD tree, `.gitignore` has entry, `git status` clean. Committed as `dee670e`. |
