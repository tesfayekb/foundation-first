# Deferred Work Register

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-10

## Purpose

Authoritative registry for postponed items that were originally part of an approved plan section. Ensures deferred work is not lost, is formally tracked with blocking dependencies, and is explicitly reassigned to a future phase before that phase begins.

**This is NOT for new feature proposals** — those belong in [feature-proposals.md](feature-proposals.md).
This document is for work that was **already approved** in the master plan but could not be completed in its original phase.

## Scope

All deferred subsections, gate items, or deliverables from approved plan sections that were not completed in their original phase.

## Enforcement Rules (CRITICAL)

- When any approved plan subsection is marked `deferred`, a corresponding entry **MUST** be created here
- When any phase gate item is deferred or marked N/A, a corresponding entry **MUST** be created here
- No phase may be formally closed with deferred items unless all deferred items have entries in this register
- Deferred items **MUST** be assigned to a future phase before that phase's planning begins
- Unassigned deferred items must be reviewed at every phase boundary
- Items may only be `cancelled` via change control with a decision record (DEC-NNN)

## Entry Schema (MANDATORY)

Each deferred item MUST include all of the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique ID: `DW-NNN` |
| `date_deferred` | Date the item was deferred |
| `source_plan_section` | Original plan section ID (e.g., PLAN-AUTH-001-B) |
| `source_phase` | Phase where work was originally planned |
| `title` | Short descriptive title |
| `reason_deferred` | Why it could not be completed |
| `blocking_dependencies` | What must be resolved before resuming |
| `impact_on_source_phase` | How deferral affected the source phase's completion |
| `future_owner_phase` | Target phase for resumption (or `unassigned`) |
| `future_owner_module` | Module that will own this work |
| `required_plan_realignment` | What plan changes are needed when this work resumes |
| `related_decisions` | DEC-NNN references |
| `related_actions` | ACT-NNN references |
| `required_tests_for_closure` | Tests/gates that must pass when implemented |
| `status` | See status legend below |
| `implemented_by_action` | ACT-NNN when eventually implemented |
| `implemented_in_plan_version` | Plan version when implemented |

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `deferred` | Postponed, not yet assigned to a future phase |
| `assigned` | Assigned to a specific future phase |
| `in-progress` | Actively being implemented in the assigned phase |
| `implemented` | Completed and verified |
| `cancelled` | Permanently dropped via change control |

## Phase Boundary Review Rule

At each phase boundary (before advancing to the next phase):

1. Review ALL open deferred items (status = `deferred` or `assigned`)
2. Confirm blocking dependencies are still accurate
3. Confirm future phase assignment is still appropriate
4. If a deferred item's future phase is the upcoming phase → it **MUST** be included in that phase's scope
5. Document review outcome in action tracker

| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | RLS tested at database level (not just API) |
| **Reason Deferred** | Requires manual DB-level testing with test users in different role contexts |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Deployed schema; test users with assigned roles; ability to execute queries as different Postgres roles |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 2 gate remains open |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (pre-integration) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |

| **ID** | DW-005 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 (Phase 2 gate item 11) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Cross-tenant isolation verification |
| **Reason Deferred** | System is single-tenant for v1 — gate item is mis-scoped for current architecture |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Change control decision to either mark N/A for v1 or defer to multi-tenancy introduction |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 2 gate technically open; requires plan amendment to resolve |
| **Future Owner Phase** | `unassigned` — pending plan amendment via change control |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Amend Phase 2 gate item 11 via change control to reflect v1 single-tenant scope |
| **Related Decisions** | DEC-022 |

### DW-006: Role Change Cache Invalidation Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-006 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 (Phase 2 gate item 12) |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Role change immediately reflected (cache invalidation verified) |
| **Reason Deferred** | No permission cache exists; fresh RPC fetches used. Runtime E2E verification of role-change propagation to UI not yet performed |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | Deployed edge functions; test user with assignable roles; runtime E2E test capability |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 2 gate remains open |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (pre-integration) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Must verify before admin panel role management UI is built in Phase 4 |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-017 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Assign role → verify UI reflects new permissions without page reload; revoke role → verify UI removes permissions; verify no stale authorization state |
| **Status** | `implemented` |
| **Implemented by Action** | ACT-020 |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | v7 |
| **Resolution Note** | No permission cache exists — architecture uses fresh DB queries via get_my_authorization_context() RPC on every check. Role changes are inherently immediate. Last-superadmin guard trigger fires instantly. |

### DW-007: Moderator Role

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-007 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Moderator role deferred to v2 |
| **Reason Deferred** | Decided to limit v1 to superadmin/admin/user only |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | v2 planning and scope definition |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | None — v1 RBAC schema supports dynamic roles; moderator can be added without schema change |
| **Future Owner Phase** | `unassigned` — v2 scope |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | v2 planning must include moderator role definition, permission mapping, and UI integration |

| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-AUTH-001-D |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 1 — Foundation (Auth) |
| **Title** | MFA recovery code generation, storage, and usage |
| **Reason Deferred** | Core MFA (TOTP enroll + verify) prioritized first; recovery codes are secondary safety net |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | MFA enrollment flow operational (done); hashed storage mechanism for recovery codes; UI for code display + regeneration |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | Phase 1 closed as `approved-partial` — MFA enrollment works but recovery path not yet available |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 4 — Admin & User Interfaces (user-panel MFA configuration) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-AUTH-001, PLAN-USRPNL-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 4 user-panel MFA configuration section must include recovery code generation, display, regeneration, and single-use consumption |
| **Related Decisions** | DEC-017 (MFA recovery code format: 10 codes, 8 alphanumeric, single-use, hashed storage) |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-010, ACT-011 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Recovery code generation (10 codes returned), code display + copy UX, single-use consumption (code works once then invalidated), full set regeneration (old codes invalidated), hashed storage verification (no plaintext in DB), recovery code + re-enrollment flow |
| **Status** | `assigned` |

### DW-009: requireRole() Shared Function

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DW-009 |
| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Server-side requireRole() guard function |
| **Reason Deferred** | Phase 2 focused on schema, helpers, and edge function foundation; requireRole() is a consumer-facing guard needed when modules start enforcing role checks |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | has_role() DB function operational (done); edge function auth pattern established (done) |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact on Phase 2 gate — requireRole() is a downstream consumer utility, not a gate item |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (needed before user-management and API modules enforce role checks) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001, PLAN-API-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 3 must implement requireRole() before any edge function uses role-based access control |
| **Related Decisions** | — |
| **Related Actions** | ACT-015, ACT-017 |
| **Required Tests for Closure** | Correct role → access allowed; wrong role → 403; no role → 403; superadmin bypass verified; integration with edge function auth pattern |
| **Status** | `assigned` |
| **Implemented by Action** | — |
| **Implemented in Plan Version** | — |

| **Date Deferred** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Source Plan Section** | PLAN-RBAC-001 |
| **Source Phase** | Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC) |
| **Title** | Server-side requireSelfScope() guard function |
| **Reason Deferred** | Phase 2 focused on schema, helpers, and edge function foundation; requireSelfScope() is needed when user-owned resource endpoints are built |
| **Blocking Dependencies** | getSessionContext() operational (done); user-owned resource endpoints exist (Phase 3/4) |
| **Impact on Source Phase** | No impact on Phase 2 gate — requireSelfScope() is a downstream consumer utility |
| **Future Owner Phase** | Phase 3 — Core Services (needed before user-management self-scope endpoints) |
| **Future Owner Module** | PLAN-RBAC-001, PLAN-USRMGMT-001 |
| **Required Plan Realignment** | Phase 3 must implement requireSelfScope() before user-management self-edit/self-view endpoints |
