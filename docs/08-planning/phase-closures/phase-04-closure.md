### Contract Reconciliation Gates

| 7 | All permission checks match permission-index.md | **PASS** | 10 keys verified: admin.access, audit.view, mfa.self_manage, profile.self_manage, roles.view, users.view_all, permissions.assign/revoke, roles.assign/revoke |
| 8 | component-inventory.md reconciled with actual components | **PASS** | 21 total entries: 15 dashboard + 4 admin + 1 user + 1 auth — all matched against filesystem |

## 3. Security Hardening Applied During Phase 4

| Fix | Severity | Implementation |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| MFA removal re-authentication | CRITICAL | ReauthDialog with supabase.auth.reauthenticate() + email OTP required before unenrollFactor() |
| Password change re-authentication | HIGH | Replaced client-only isRecentlyAuthenticated with reauthenticate() + OTP flow; form hidden until verified |
| Session inactivity timeout | HIGH | 30-minute idle timer via useInactivityTimeout hook; mousemove/keydown/touchstart/scroll/visibilitychange; auto-signout + redirect |
| Admin MFA enforcement | HIGH | AdminLayout redirects to /mfa-enroll if mfaStatus === 'none' (ACT-046) |
| isRecentlyAuthenticated threshold | MEDIUM | Raised from 5 to 30 minutes |

---

## 4. Performance Optimizations Applied

| Fix | Impact | Implementation |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| Admin panel prefetching | HIGH | AdminLayout prefetches roles, permissions, users, audit-logs on mount |
| User panel prefetching | HIGH | UserLayout prefetches profile, MFA factors on mount |
| staleTime optimization | MEDIUM | Roles/permissions raised to 5 minutes; users/audit stay at 30 seconds |
| AdminDashboard cache warming | LOW | Replaced direct Supabase queries with useRoles() — warms shared cache |
| QueryClient defaults | LOW | defaultOptions: { queries: { staleTime: 30_000 } } as safety net |
| RequirePermission loading state | LOW | Shows LoadingSkeleton instead of null during auth context load |

---

## 9. Deferred Items from Phase 4

| ID | Title | Future Phase |
|----|-------|-------------|
| DW-018 | Admin role detail — permission add/remove inline | Phase 6 (closed: implemented via RoleDetailPage) |
| DW-027 | Admin edit user profile inline | Phase 6 (closed: implemented via AdminEditProfileCard) |
| DW-008 | MFA recovery codes | Phase 6 (open) |

---

## 10. Known Limitations

1. **MFA recovery codes**: Not implemented — placeholder shown on SecurityPage. Tracked as DW-008, assigned to Phase 6.
2. **Profile edit has no re-auth gate**: Display name and avatar URL changes are cosmetic and ungated beyond standard authentication. Acceptable for v1.
3. **Email verification not enforced on /settings/security**: Users with unverified email can access security settings. Low risk — actions within are re-auth gated.
4. **Session timeout is client-side only**: The 30-minute inactivity timer runs in the browser. Server-side JWT refresh continues independently. A stolen refresh token is not invalidated by the client-side timeout. Server-side session revocation is a Phase 6 item.

---

## 11. Phase Gate Compliance

- All 14 gate items: **PASSED**
- Evidence standard: **MET** (code review + runtime verification for all gates)
- Minimal-fix discipline: **MAINTAINED** (no scope drift during hardening)
- SSOT reconciliation: **COMPLETE** (component-inventory, route-index, permission-index all internally consistent)
- Security hardening: **APPLIED** (3 critical/high findings fixed)
- Performance optimization: **APPLIED** (6 optimizations, zero cold-load delays)

**Phase 4 is CLOSED.**

---

## 12. Post-Closure Addendum

The following work was completed after Phase 4 closure (ACT-048) as post-closure hardening and gap closure. All items address findings discovered during post-closure review.

### ACT-049: Recent-Auth Window Alignment (2026-04-12)

Aligned all 8 privileged edge functions to 30-minute recent-auth window for consistency with InactivityGuard.

### ACT-050: Role CRUD + Recent-Auth Alignment (2026-04-12)

Full role lifecycle: create-role + delete-role edge functions and UI. DW-025 and DW-026 closed.

### ACT-051: Permission Dependency Enforcement + roles.edit (2026-04-12)

- PERMISSION_DEPS map with transitive resolution (src/config/permission-deps.ts)
- Server-side auto-insert of missing dependencies in assign-permission-to-role
- Client-side dependency badge + revocation blocking on RoleDetailPage
- update-role edge function + inline edit UI on RoleDetailPage
- roles.edit permission seeded, rbac.role_updated event documented

### ACT-052: permissions.view Separation + Superadmin Restriction (2026-04-12)

- permissions.view separated from roles.view — distinct gate for permissions catalog
- permissions.assign and permissions.revoke restricted to superadmin-only
- Privilege escalation via custom roles eliminated
- Explanatory message for admin users on disabled permission checkboxes

### ACT-053: Audit Log RLS Security Fix (2026-04-12)

- Removed INSERT WITH CHECK (true) policy from audit_logs
- Prevented authenticated users from fabricating/polluting audit trail
- Audit writes now exclusively via service-role client (edge functions)

### ACT-054: RLS + Performance + Server-Side Dependency Enforcement (2026-04-12)

- permissions_select_policy RLS updated: checks `permissions.view` instead of `roles.view` — closes bypass where `roles.view` holders could query permissions catalog directly
- `idx_audit_logs_target_id` index added for UserDetailPage audit queries
- `depends_on` field added to permission-index schema; all 31 entries populated from PERMISSION_DEPS
- Server-side dependency enforcement in `revoke-permission-from-role`: refuses revocation if another assigned permission depends on the target permission (returns 409 with `DEPENDENCY_VIOLATION` code and blocker list)
- `sql/03_rbac_rls_policies.sql` reference file updated to match live DB

### Updated Component Count

22 governed UI components (was 21 at closure — CreateRoleDialog added in ACT-050).

### Updated Permission Count

31 permissions (was 29 at closure — roles.edit and permissions.view added).
