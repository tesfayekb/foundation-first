## Development Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Auth + Infrastructure)

**Modules:** PLAN-AUTH-001
**Depends On:** PLAN-GOV-001 (implemented)

**Milestones:**
- Lovable Cloud enabled with database, auth, and storage
- Email/password sign-up, sign-in, sign-out functional
- Google OAuth and Apple Sign-In functional
- MFA enrollment and verification operational
- Password reset flow complete
- Session management and token lifecycle working
- Auth shared functions available (`getCurrentUser`, `requireAuth`, etc.)
- All auth events emitting correctly

**Phase Gate — must ALL pass before advancing:**
- [x] All auth user flows pass E2E tests — *ACT-011: Browser E2E 2026-04-09 (sign-in, sign-up, forgot-password, MFA-challenge, MFA-enroll tested)*
- [x] Auth failure modes tested (invalid session, expired token, failed MFA) — *ACT-014: (1) Invalid credentials → error toast + auth.failed_attempt event emitted, (2) Expired/invalid reset token → "Invalid reset link" page with recovery CTA, (3) MFA challenge without enrollment → error toast + disabled verify button. All fail-secure.*
- [x] Auth events verified against event-index.md — *ACT-011: `auth.failed_attempt` emission runtime-verified via console*
- [x] Auth shared functions verified against function-index.md — *ACT-013: Full cross-reference audit — all functions reconciled with code*
- [x] Auth security validated per auth-security.md — *ACT-014: Systematic validation: password policy (min 12 chars ✓), session management (Supabase JWT + refresh rotation ✓), MFA TOTP (enrollment + challenge ✓), sensitive flow protection (re-auth utility ✓), rate limiting (Supabase-managed ✓), audit events (all 8 auth events defined + emitting ✓). Status table updated. OAuth deferred per PLAN-AUTH-001-B/C.*
- [x] No security scan findings on auth module — *Security scan 2026-04-09: zero findings*

### Phase 2 — Access Control (RBAC)

**Modules:** PLAN-RBAC-001
**Depends On:** Phase 1 complete

**Milestones:**
- `user_roles` table created with RLS
- `has_role()` security definer function operational
- Role assignment and revocation working
- Permission enforcement at API/edge function level
- RLS policies enforced on all protected tables
- Permission cache with tenant-scoped invalidation
- V1 roles active: `superadmin`, `admin`, `user`

**Phase Gate — must ALL pass before advancing:**
- [ ] Every permission has allow + deny test
- [ ] RLS tested at database level (not just API)
- [ ] Cross-tenant isolation verified (zero rows, not errors)
- [ ] Role change immediately reflected (cache invalidation verified)
- [ ] Permission index matches implementation
- [ ] No privilege escalation paths found

### Phase 3 — Core Services (User Management, Audit, API)

**Milestones:**
- User CRUD with account lifecycle management
- Immutable audit trail recording all significant actions

**Milestones:**
- Admin panel: user management, role management, audit log viewer, system health dashboard
- User panel: profile management, settings, MFA configuration, session management
- Admin actions enforced by RBAC (not UI-only)
- All admin-privileged operations audited

**Phase Gate — must ALL pass before advancing:**
- [ ] Admin actions verified with correct and incorrect roles (allow + deny)
- [ ] User panel flows pass E2E tests
- [ ] No admin capability accessible without proper role
- [ ] UI loading/error states for all async operations
- [ ] Accessibility baseline met

---

### Phase 5 — Operations & Reliability (Health Monitoring, Jobs)

**Modules:** PLAN-HEALTH-001, PLAN-JOBS-001
**Depends On:** Phase 1 complete (minimum); Phase 3 recommended for full integration (audit events, API execution layer)

**Milestones:**
- Health checks operational for all critical subsystems
- Metrics tracking and alerting configured
- Job scheduling via pg_cron operational
- Retry logic, failure handling, and dead-letter queue functional
- Kill switch and circuit breakers active

**Phase Gate — must ALL pass before advancing:**

- [ ] Poison job detection and isolation verified
- [ ] Kill switch stops execution immediately
- [ ] Health and job events emitting correctly

---

### Phase 6 — Hardening & System Validation

**Modules:** All
**Depends On:** Phases 1–5 complete

**Milestones:**
- Full security scan — zero critical/high findings
- Performance baselines established (p95/p99 latency, bundle size)
- Regression test suite complete for all critical paths
- Cross-module integration verified end-to-end
- All SSOT indexes accurate and complete

**Phase Gate — release readiness:**
- [ ] All E2E critical flows pass
- [ ] Security adversarial tests pass (privilege escalation, injection, replay)
- [ ] Performance within budget (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)
- [ ] All regression watchlist items have regression tests
- [ ] All reference indexes verified against implementation
- [ ] System-state.md reflects accurate module status
- [ ] Full observability coverage — all critical paths emit events and logs with traceability (correlation_id)

---

## Phase Gate Rules

- No phase may advance without ALL gate conditions satisfied
- Gate verification must be **explicit and documented** — not assumed
- Failed gate conditions must be fixed and retested before advancing — no partial progression with known failures
- If a phase gate fails, changes must be **rolled back or corrected** before re-validation
- Gate verification must include **evidence** (test results, logs, screenshots, or metrics) — evidence must be traceable in action-tracker.md or linked artifacts
- Phase gate results logged in action-tracker.md
- Auth, RBAC, and Security gates are **never waivable**
- Schema changes after Phase 3 require **HIGH-impact change control** with rollback plan

## Execution Order

Based on dependency chains and phases:

1. ~~PLAN-GOV-001~~ (implemented)
2. **Phase 1:** PLAN-AUTH-001
3. **Phase 2:** PLAN-RBAC-001
4. **Phase 3:** PLAN-USRMGMT-001, PLAN-AUDIT-001, PLAN-API-001 (parallel)
5. **Phase 4:** PLAN-ADMIN-001, PLAN-USRPNL-001
6. **Phase 5:** PLAN-HEALTH-001, PLAN-JOBS-001 (can overlap with Phase 3/4)
7. **Phase 6:** System-wide hardening and validation

## Execution Rules

- Only `approved` or `approved-partial` sections may be executed
- Execution must follow phase order and dependency chain
- No execution outside approved baseline
- All changes must follow [change-control-policy.md](../00-governance/change-control-policy.md)
- Phase gates are mandatory — no skipping

## Dependencies

- [Constitution](../00-governance/constitution.md)
- [System State](../00-governance/system-state.md)
