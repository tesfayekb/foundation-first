# Action Tracker

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-09

## Purpose

Central operational record that tracks every completed action with classification, verification evidence, SSOT traceability, lifecycle management, and system impact analysis. Serves as the enforcement backbone for change governance.

## Scope

All tasks performed on the project: features, fixes, refactors, security changes, performance work, regression fixes, risk mitigations, and documentation updates.

## Enforcement Rule (CRITICAL)

- No change is complete until:
  - Action tracker entry created with full metadata
  - Verification evidence recorded
  - Related documentation updated
- Incomplete or missing entry = **INVALID** change
- Entries are **append-only** — no retroactive editing of completed entries
- Corrections must be appended as new entries referencing the original, not edited in place
- Historical accuracy must be preserved — audit trail must be fully reconstructable

---

## Action Classification

Every action must be classified:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Feature** | New functionality | New API endpoint, UI component, job |
| **Fix** | Bug correction | Error handling fix, data correction |
| **Refactor** | Code improvement without behavior change | Architecture cleanup, performance optimization |
| **Security** | Security-related change | RLS policy, auth hardening, vulnerability fix |
| **Performance** | Performance improvement | Query optimization, caching, bundle reduction |
| **Regression** | Regression fix | Restoring broken behavior |
| **Risk** | Risk mitigation action | Control implementation, risk response |
| **Documentation** | Documentation update | SSOT updates, governance changes |

---

- `Completed` without verification evidence cannot be marked `Verified`
- `Rolled Back` must reference the issue and link to follow-up action

### Risk Resolution Tracking

- If action resolves a risk → must link risk ID in `related_risks`
- Risk register entry must be updated to reflect resolution
- Resolution evidence in action tracker = risk resolution evidence

### Regression Tracking

- If action introduces regression → must link watchlist item in `related_watchlist`
- Regression fix actions must reference the original regression
- Repeated failures in same area → tracked via recurrence in watchlist, referenced here

### Watchlist Verification

- Watchlist verification during changes → must reference action tracker entry
- Action tracker provides the evidence chain for watchlist compliance

---

## Change Control Integration

- Every action must reference its change control classification (Low/Medium/High)
- HIGH impact actions must include pre/post state tracking
- Actions resulting from change control workflow reference the change ID
- Actions that bypass normal workflow must document override justification

---

## Action Quality Gate

An action **cannot** be marked `Verified` unless:

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|------------|
| Verification evidence present | Test run, log, screenshot, or monitoring link |
| Related watchlist items verified | All matching items checked with evidence |
| Related risks updated | Risk register reflects resolution/status change |
| Post-deploy validation completed | If validation window defined, stability confirmed |
| No regression introduced | Regression checks passed, no new watchlist items from this action |
| Metrics validated | If `metrics_affected` defined, before/after values recorded |

**Rule:** Quality gate is mandatory for all actions. HIGH-impact actions require all gates; LOW-impact actions require at minimum evidence + no regression.

---

## System-Level Action Gate

Before any HIGH-impact change is finalized, the system must confirm:

| Confirmation | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| Action recorded with full metadata | This document |
| Evidence validated | Verification fields |
| Regression checks passed | Regression Strategy |
| Risk register updated | Risk Register |
| Watchlist items verified | Regression Watchlist |
| Metrics validated (if applicable) | Before/after values |
| Validation window defined | For runtime/continuous verification |
| Blast radius documented | State tracking fields |

**Gate failure = action cannot be marked Verified.**

---

## Verification Scope Rules

| Scope | Definition | Required For |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Immediate** | One-time verification at completion | All actions |
| **Runtime** | Verified via monitoring after deployment | Medium/High deployed changes |
| **Continuous** | Ongoing monitoring confirms sustained correctness | HIGH impact: RBAC, RLS, auth, security changes |

**Rules:**
- HIGH impact actions must include runtime or continuous verification scope
- Continuous verification must define what signals confirm ongoing correctness
- Verification scope failure (e.g., runtime regression detected) → status reverts to `Completed` + new corrective action created

---

## Metric Correlation Enforcement

When `metrics_affected` is defined, the entry must include:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Metric name | API p95 latency |
| Before value | 420ms |
| After value | 310ms |
| Measurement method | Monitoring dashboard, load test |

**Rule:** Metric claims without before/after values are not valid evidence.

---

## Action Drift Detection

Over time, action outcomes may become invalid due to later changes:

- Periodic review (quarterly) must check:
  - Are HIGH-impact action outcomes still valid?
  - Has subsequent work invalidated assumptions?
  - Have metrics regressed since verification?
- If drift detected:
  - Create new corrective action referencing the original
  - Update related risks and watchlist items

---

## Immutability Rules

- Entries are **append-only** — historical entries must never be modified
- Corrections to past entries must be appended as new correction entries:
  - Reference original entry ID
  - Explain correction
  - Preserve original for audit trail
- Status changes are forward-only (except `Rolled Back` which references the issue)
- Audit trail must be fully reconstructable from the action log

---
