# System State

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-09

## Purpose

Single source of truth for the current state of the project.

This file controls:
- What actions are allowed
- What phase the system is in
- Which plan baseline is active

It MUST be read before every task.

## Scope

Tracks:
- Phase
- Code generation status
- Module implementation status
- Active work
- Plan versioning

## Enforcement Rule (CRITICAL)

- This file MUST be read before any task begins
- If this file is outdated or inconsistent → execution is **INVALID**
- If required updates are missing → tasks must **STOP** until corrected
- This file overrides assumptions — only the state defined here is valid

## Current State

```yaml
status: implementation in progress
phase: development
code_generation: allowed
modules_implemented: auth partial (A+D implemented + hardened, B+C deferred), rbac (Phase 2 schema + helpers + RLS + seed + edge functions + client helpers)
active_work: Phase 2 RBAC complete — schema, security helpers, RLS policies, seed data applied; edge functions verified; client-side helpers operational. Ready for Phase 3.
current_plan_version: v4
approved_plan_baseline: v4
plan_status: approved
last_updated: 2026-04-09
```

## Execution Control Rules

- If `code_generation: blocked` → **NO** code may be generated
- If `phase: documentation-only` → **ONLY** documentation tasks allowed
- If `approved_plan_baseline: none` → **NO** implementation allowed
- Execution MUST use the approved plan baseline defined here

## Update Rule

This file MUST be updated when any of the following occur:
- Architecture changes
- Module status changes (started, in progress, completed)
- Phase changes (documentation → development)
- Plan version changes (new version approved)
- Code generation status changes

**Failure to update this file = INVALID system state**

## Consistency Requirement

This file MUST remain consistent with:
- `master-plan.md`
- `approved-decisions.md`
- `action-tracker.md`
- Module documentation status

If inconsistency is detected → execution must **STOP** and be corrected.

## Module Status Tracker

| Module | Status | Last Updated |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| auth | in progress (A+D implemented + hardened: shared functions, events, email gate; B+C deferred) | 2026-04-09 |
| rbac | implemented (Phase 2: schema, helpers, RLS, seed, edge functions, client helpers) | 2026-04-09 |
| user-management | not started | — |
| admin-panel | not started | — |
| user-panel | not started | — |
| audit-logging | not started | — |
| health-monitoring | not started | — |
| api | not started | — |
| jobs-and-scheduler | not started | — |

## AI Behavior Constraint

- AI must **NOT** modify this file unless triggered by the defined update rules
- AI must **NOT** assume state — only this file defines the current system state
- If unclear → **STOP** and request clarification

## Dependencies

- [Constitution](constitution.md)
- [Master Plan](../08-planning/master-plan.md)

## Used By / Affects

All tasks, planning, and execution decisions.

## Risks If Changed

HIGH — incorrect state causes incorrect execution, plan drift, and system inconsistency.
